[equalize_histogram]
comment = Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Cliplimit between: 2-40.
active = 0
clip = 2
size = 10

[statistics]
comment = Range grayscale, where to determine mean and standard deviation. Usefull for (some) pictures with double peaks, and large portions of black. Filtering/removing extra black peak from statistics (mean-stdev). Note that bright distribtion of image must be within these bounds. 
lower_bound = 75
upper_bound = 255

[morphing_open]
comment = Erosion followed by dilation. Useful for removing noise. When activated small defects might not be detected.
active = 0
size = 10

[morphing_close]
comment = Dilation followed by Erosion. Useful closing small holes in foreground objects. Effect more prominant for bigger defects.
active = 1
size = 10

[white_defects]
comment = Adaptive Thresholding Gaussian white/bright defects. Local detection of contours based on a scan region (local_size), for large defects set size higher. White treshold grayscale (red color) as number of standard deviations from mean (treshold). 
local_size = 50
treshold = 5

[black_defects]
comment = Adaptive Thresholding Gaussian black/dark defects. Local detection of contours based on a scan region (local_size), for large defects set size higher. Black treshold grayscale (green color) as number of standard deviations from mean (treshold). 
local_size = 50
treshold = 5

[data]
comment = Analysis options and saving resolution. Coordinates x, y as determined by "snake" scanning, starting: West-East-South-West-South-East etc. Set number of columns depending on  number of scans in x direction. Saving image resolution dpi (dots per inch), typicical setting dpi=150 for acceptable quality and quick saving.
columns = 16
rows = 16
dpi = 150
