[equalize_histogram]
comment = Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization. Cliplimit between: 2 - 40.
active = 0
clip = 2
size = 10

[morphing_open]
comment = Erosion followed by dilation. Useful for removing noise. When activated small defects might not be detected.
active = 0
size = 10

[morphing_close]
comment = Dilation followed by Erosion. Useful closing small holes in foreground objects. Effect more prominant for bigger defects.
active = 1
size = 10

[white_defects]
comment = Adaptive Thresholding Gaussian white defects (number of stdev). White defects when higher treshold grayscale (red color). The threshold for a pixel based on a small region around it (for large defects set size higher).
white_local_size = 100
white_treshold = 5

[black_defects]
comment = Adaptive Thresholding Gaussian black defects. Black defects when lower treshold grayscale (green color). The threshold for a pixel based on a small region around it (for large defects set size higher).
black_local_size = 100
black_treshold = 5
